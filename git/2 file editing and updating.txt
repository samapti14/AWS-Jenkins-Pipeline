(after editing file)

=> git status

(It will show the modified files)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   jenskin admin key.txt
        modified:   notes.txt
		
"I want to stage only 1 file"

=>git add notes.txt

(then we need to commit the changes)

=> git commit -m "notes.txt"
