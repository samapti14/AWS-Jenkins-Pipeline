[to check the status of git repository]

=> git status  
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
(this error means I am not inside any git repository)

to make your directory a git repository

=> git init
(nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track))
we need to add all the file present in that folder


to make all of the files and folders in git repository ready for next commit (Or we can say putting them in staging area)
=> git add --a
(git all)

=> git status
(No commits yet)

=> git commit -m "<message>"
